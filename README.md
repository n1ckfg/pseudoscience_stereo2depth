<a href="https://youtu.be/i-QTbpjj4Mw?t=41">Here is a video</a> about getting Stereo2Depth up and running.

 Once you have an equirectangular color image and a corresponding equirectangular depth map, simply stack them so the color image is on top and the depth map is on the bottom. Any resolution is acceptable, but for videos, the optimal settings for playback at the moment seem to be 2048x2048, h264 mp4. Photos should be jpeg or png.
